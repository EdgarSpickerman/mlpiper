4 Creating and Launching MLApps
=============================

In this chapter, we describe the basics of creating and launching MLApps.
In later chapters, we provide more advanced features. MCenter uses the
following concepts for creating and managing MLApps.

Model
-----

In MCenter, a model typically refers to an ML model, such as KMeans
centroids, or a DL model, such as a ResNet network with its learned
weights and biases.

Component<a name="component"></a>
---------

A component is a program or unit of processing. Components are the building
blocks for pipelines. MCenter recognizes different types of components
based on their functions.

-   **Source components** generate data for the pipeline. For example,
    they read input from a file and output the values to the next
    component in the pipeline.

-   **Feature engineering components** encode their input into a form
    that facilitates processing by other components further down the
    pipeline.

-   **Algorithm components** typically perform the main function of the
    pipeline. If this is a training component, it may output a model.
    Alternatively, if it is an inference component, it may require a
    model as an input parameter. For example, a component that computes
    KMeans is algorithm component.

-   **Flow shaping components** enable you to create pipeline structures
    that fork, which are useful for creating comparison pipelines where
    the input component is shared.

-   **Sink components** direct the final output of the pipeline, for
    example, by writing it to a database.

Pipeline<a name="pipeline"></a>
--------

A pipeline consists of one or more components chained together such that
output of a previous component becomes the input to the next component.
Each pipeline has a particular purpose, such as to train a model or
generate inferences. Each pipeline runs on a particular engine type
(e.g., Spark, Container).

MCenter supports the following types of pipelines:

-   **Training pipelines** contain a component marked as model producer.
    These pipelines are expected to generate a model at the end of their
    run.

-   **Inference pipelines** contain a component marked as a model consumer.
    These pipelines are expected to use a model provided to them.

-   **Training and inference pipelines** consume a model and also
    produce one. A retraining pipeline could use this type.

-   **Auxiliary pipelines** do not generate or consume a model. These
    pipelines are used for generating reports, computing ML-health,
    feature pre-processing, and so on.

MLApp<a name="mlapp"></a>
-----

An MLApp consists of one or more pipelines. The MLApp contains information
about how its pipelines are orchestrated with respect to one
another. For example, the model produced by one pipeline may be consumed
by another pipeline. More generally, an MLApp represents the relationship
between its constituent pipelines as a directed graph, where each node is
a pipeline and the edges between nodes signifies communication between
the pipelines. In this example, the communicated message is a
trained model.

Although each pipeline can only run on one engine type, MLApps can contain
pipelines that run on different engine types.

MCenter supports **Patterns** and **Profiles** for all MLApps. Patterns help
capture the structure and dependencies within an MLApp. Through patterns, an
MLApp can be leveraged for for multiple use cases. Profiles provide the ability
to modify pipeline parameters, configuration (such as schedule) and policies
without having to recreate a new MLApp.
