7 Business Integration
======================

ML pipelines do not exist in isolation but as part of the
ecosystem of a larger application. MCenter provides features that allow
you to manage ML initiatives as such. Firstly, MCenter recognizes that
user decisions and actions impact ML applications. MCenter integrates
these user actions as events in MLApp timelines. This facilitates
diagnostics and compliance requirements. Secondly, MCenter supports
importing arbitrary business metrics to facilitate correlating ML
pipelines with quantified business objectives. Finally, MCenter supports
reports with top-level summaries of all MLApp activity.
