6 Governance
============

The governance functionality of MCenter enables reproducibility and
compliance. You can track the entire lineage of any model, prediction,
code, event, approval, or other object. MCenter automatically captures all
relevant information, including the MLApp, pipeline, and component that
produced the model (or other object), along with all uses, events, and
statistics related to it.

You can upload external models into MCenter via the
UI. Uploaded models record the user who uploaded them and the time of the
upload, and you can add arbitrary annotations to describe them. Similarly,
you can download models from the MCenter UI onto your local machine.
