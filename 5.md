5 Monitoring and Health
=======================

ParallelM MCenter provides a comprehensive set of tools to monitor,
diagnose, and improve the functioning of ML pipelines. These include
dashboards, alerts, diagnostic recordings, and tools to detect
unexpected behavior from ML models. All diagnostic components,
statistics, events, and alerts are available both as built-in functions
and as interfaces to enable custom development.

Dashboards
----------

To easily visualize the state of all launched MLApps, the MCenter UI includes
several views:

-   **MLApp Overview** - A high-level view of all MLApps, their overall run
    statuses, and any alerts.

-   **Health View** - A per-MLApp view for each pipeline showing an event timeline, 
    live heatmap of input features, and data distribution histograms to help
    detect changes in data patterns.

-   **Data Science View** - Per-component views and
    custom statistics relevant to those components, such as confusion
    matrices and cost functions. This view enables drill-down into
    component logs.

Use the [Time Picker](./5_4.md) to determine the start and end times for each view.

Timeline Captures
-----------------

You can use timeline captures to capture the state of an MLApp
during a given timespan. By saving all MLApp configuration information,
events, user actions, and statistics, timeline captures enable you to
investigate the state and changes to the MLApp during a designated period.

ML Health
---------

MCenter exposes metrics and mechanisms to flag potential issues with
the use of ML/DL models. You can use a built-in library for
detecting issues, such as input feature drift, or you can write and
upload your own custom components using the MLOps module.
Per-MLApp configuration settings enable you to configure the deviation
threshold for raising alerts.

MCenter facilitates comparing pipelines with new models to a baseline or
*canary* pipeline. When the pipelines differ beyond a threshold, MCenter
raises an alert.

A/B Testing
-----------

MCenter facilitates the creation and monitoring of A/B pipelines to compare
different pipelines.
