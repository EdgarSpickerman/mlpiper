3 System Configuration
======================

You must configure
your system before using MCenter for the first time. After that, you only
need to update the configuration as your environment and usages change.

In this section, we discuss how to configure these aspects of MCenter:

- [Managing user accounts](./3_1.md)
- [Configuring agents to work with your analytic engines](./3_2.md)
- [Configuring execution environments](./execution_environments.md)
- [Managing user permissions with Role-based Access Control](./3_4.md)
