3.1 Users
=========

This section describes user management in MCenter.

Account Types
-------------

MCenter supports two types of accounts: *user* and *service*.
With a user account you can upload models, create pipelines
and MLApps, and launch them into the *sandbox* environment.
With a service account you can run MLApps in the *production*
environment.

**Note:** You must create a service account before you can launch an
MLApp in the production environment.

Authentication Modes
--------------------

MCenter supports two types of authentication modes: *internal* and *LDAP*.
When adding a new user, the administrator must choose one of these
modes. Internal mode allows you to configure a password on the MCenter
system; LDAP mode uses the password managed by the LDAP system.

**Note:** An administrator must register a user and choose the appropriate
authentication mode. In the absence of this step, a log-in attempt fails
even if the user is configured via LDAP.

RBAC Roles
----------

MCenter supports assigning one or more access control roles to each user. See
the section on [Role-based Access Control](./3_4.md) for details on *roles* and how to set up permissions. When
applying the permissions for user actions, all roles this user belongs to
are considered before denying a request.

**Note:** The **Roles** selection is required when creating a new user.

Admin Account
-------------

The *admin* user account is pre-installed in MCenter. The admin
user can create other users, register MCenter agents, and manage
execution environments.

**Note:** Change the default admin password the first time you run the
system. Failing to do so may compromise security.

Data Scientist Account (DS)
---------------------------

The *ds* user account is pre-installed in MCenter. The ds user can
create MLApps and launch them into the sandbox environment.
