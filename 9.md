# 9 Bundled Materials

This document contains description of the Spark modules (and associated
reporting statistics) that are available for Spark with MCenter Version
1.0. We also present some examples of MLApps that can be constructed using
these modules.

In addition to this, users may upload custom code and insert custom
instrumentation via the MLOps API. Users may also modify MCenter's provided
code modules (those listed here) and add additional instrumentation
beyond what is available by default. Details on how to use the MLOps API
for instrumentation is available in the MLOps API Guide.
