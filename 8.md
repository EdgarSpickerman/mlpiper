8 Errors and Alerts
===================

The MCenter UI surfaces errors and alerts both at a high-level for easy
visualization of the overall health of the entire system and at a low
level to facilitate diagnosing the issue. At a high level, issues are
visible in the MLApp Overview dashboard, Alerts View, and per-MLApp views.
You can click on high-level error notifications in the MCenter UI to
immediately see key information about the error. When more detail is
required, the per-component Data Science View enables drill down to
component logs.
